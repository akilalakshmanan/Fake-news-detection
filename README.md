# Fake News Detection
Technology being advancing rapidly, digital news is exposed to users across the globe thereby
increasing the spread of rumors and misinformation online. This causes negative impact on social,
political and economic well-being. Most of the fake news are spread in online platforms like the
Internet and social media. Efforts had been taken to detect the fake news but however all those
efforts go in vain since it convinces the readers easily to believe the false information. The rate in
which the digital news is being produced is large and quick every second and it becomes
challenging for machine learning to detect the fake news efficiently.
But if the fake news is not able to be detected, people would no longer hold value in truth. Fake
news paves way for misleading and promoting wrong ideologies. The people who generate false
information benefit by earning money and sometimes gain favor relating to politics, for business
or even done to take some revenge. People get easily influenced since we tend to base our emotions
from the news, and sharing to friends and family further leads the spread of false information
Therefore, the main objective of the project is to detect the fake news and misinformation in
Internet and to build an effective machine learning model for the same.
